# winaday_stats_explore

Exploring probability and stats using trivial examples on a toy dataset Win2023.

## [Probability](001_Probability/notebook.ipynb)

Explore probabilistic properties of a dataset: probabilities of individual events, conditional probabilities, independence and correlation.

## [Classical hypothesis testing](002_Hypothesis_testing/notebook.ipynb)

Apply some methods of classical statistics (Binomial test, Z-test and Chi-square test) to test the hypothesis.

## [Bayesian inference](003_Bayesian_inference/notebook.ipynb)

Apply Bayesian inference to find the posterior distribution for the parameter `p` for the `Binomial(p)` distribution.
